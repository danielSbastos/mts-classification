There are three Jupyter Notebooks in this repository that were used in the submitted work. 

1. [experiments.ipynb](https://github.com/danielSbastos/mts-classification/blob/main/experiments.ipynb): where the code to preprocess the dataset and train and test the classifiers is present;
2. [analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/danielSbastos/mts-classification/blob/main/analysis.ipynb): code used to analyze the performance of the classifiers, however, without any statistical validation;
3. [hypothesis-testing.ipynb](https://github.com/danielSbastos/mts-classification/blob/main/hypothesis-testing.ipynb): code used to perform the three-phase hypothesis tests.
